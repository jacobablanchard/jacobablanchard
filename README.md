### Hi there 👋

I'm Jacob, thanks for checking out my profile! 😁

I'm currently looking to transition into the tech industry - most of my repositories here will be me learning the tools of the trade!

I mainly work with python and C++ at my job, though I have experience with (in no particular order) 
- Java
- C
- SQL
- C# (Xamarin, and WPF for frontends also)
- JavaScript (Mainly with React and TypeScript)
- Linux

I also write and maintain pipelines at work using Jenkins, so I have DevOps experience as well!

---

I love learning new things, so new languages, technologies, and fields definately don't scare me 😤
